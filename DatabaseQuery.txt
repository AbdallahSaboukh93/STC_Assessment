optimized query :
 to eliminate the subquery and make use of a self-join instead. This approach avoids the need for a nested subquery and improves the overall performance.

SELECT u.user_id, u.username, td.training_id, td.training_date, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM User u
JOIN Training_details td ON u.user_id = td.user_id
JOIN (
    SELECT user_id, training_id, DATE(training_date) AS training_date
    FROM Training_details
    GROUP BY user_id, training_id, DATE(training_date)
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) AS td2 ON td.user_id = td2.user_id
    AND td.training_id = td2.training_id
    AND DATE(td.training_date) = td2.training_date
GROUP BY u.user_id, td.training_id, DATE(td.training_date)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY td.training_date DESC;
